# Guided Neural Language Generation for Abstractive Summarization Using AMR

This repository contains code for our EMNLP 2018 paper "[Guided Neural Language Generation for Abstractive Summarization Using AMR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09160)"

# Pretrained Model

# Preprocessing the Data

python $WORK/var_free_amrs.py -f $F_TRAIN -output_path $OUTPUT --with_side
# Training New Model

# Generation with New Model
